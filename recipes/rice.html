    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a simple steamed rice recipe that we all can make in a rice cooker with one ingredient!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Jasmine rice</li>
            <li>Rice cooker</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put 5 cups of Jasmine rice in the pot that comes with the rice cooker</li>
            <li>Rinse the starch out of the rice with water until rice water is almost clear</li>
            <li>Put water in the pot until water level reaches the number 5 as indicated on 
                the inside of the rice pot (5 because we used 5 cups but that changes based
                on how many cups you are cooking)</li>
            <li>Dry the rice pot with a towel and place inside the rice cooker</li>
            <li>Close the lid on the rice cooker and flip the switch to cook</li>
            <li>Rice cooker will automatically cook the rice until it's ready (~20 minutes)</li>
